# Govee Home Assistant Integration

Control Govee lights in Home Assistant with fast IoT push updates and reliable cloud fallback.

If this integration helps you, please star it!

## Highlights

- IoT push: near‑instant updates and control (no polling needed most of the time).
- 15‑day login cache: avoids repeated logins, reduces rate‑limit risk.
- Smart discovery: names and capabilities are enriched from Govee’s app APIs.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant with [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed.
- Your Govee account email and password (used to obtain an IoT token).

## Install

1) Add as custom repository:
   - HACS → Integrations → ••• → Custom repositories → URL: `https://github.com/TheOneOgre/govee-cloud` → Category: Integration
   - Or click this button from a browser logged into Home Assistant:

     [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show a repository in the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=TheOneOgre&repository=govee-cloud&category=integration)

2) Restart Home Assistant.
3) Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Govee IoT.
4) Enter your Govee account email and password.

Notes:
- A Developer API key is not required. If present, it may be used as a fallback for certain REST calls.
- Credentials are cached under `.storage/govee_iot` for 15 days.

## Migration (from older versions)

- This release switches to IoT by default. After updating, open the Govee integration and add your email/password.
- The integration will show a Repairs issue and a persistent notification with a link to the Govee config page if credentials are missing.
- Entity unique IDs remain the same; existing automations and dashboards continue to work.

## How it works

- IoT client logs into the Govee, fetches credentials, and connects directly for IoT control.
- Device names/models are enriched from Govee’s app device list; a secondary platform list may fill gaps when needed.
- REST polling is minimized when IoT is active; a coordinated poll runs at a safe interval for reconciliation.

## Supported controls

- Power on/off
- Brightness
- Color (HS/RGB)
- Color temperature (Kelvin)

Actual features depend on your device model; the integration infers capabilities from the app APIs.

## Rate limits and caching

- Per‑device control/state token buckets reduce burstiness.
- Credentials are cached for 15 days to avoid re‑logins.

## Troubleshooting

- Logs: set `custom_components.govee` to debug in Settings → System → Logs.
- If devices show as MAC addresses briefly, names will be filled once the app device list is fetched.
- If IoT fails to start, check that credentials are set; the Repairs issue includes a link to the config page.
